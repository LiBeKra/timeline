# Latest edition for each language

In early 2024 I started to include more and more languages, and also realized how much efford this requires. Additionaly I want to include more features into my main languages German, English and Vietnamese. Starting March 2024 I therefore put the latest edition for each language into this folder and update it with new releases instead of having a long list of editions in the `/timeline` folder. Additionally each language edition will have a QR code included that directly links to these files and shows the latest edition on the respective device.

This will also allow me to link the PDFs statically from the README.md in the root folder with their respective languages. The respective edition is shown in the file itself then. Like so:
