# A Timeline of human history

Human history graph created in Jupyter Notebook, python and exported as pdf.

## Reactivation 2023

After many years it was finally time to translate the project to English and share with my friends. In the 14 years since beginning this project I learned a lot about programming languages, vector graphics and possible solutions using pandas and matplotlib. In a first stage I translated the old OpenOffice documents to english. Then I collected data into csv files for later automated processing and graph generation. This way the translation to another language is just the change of one import file.

## Vector Image with .odg in 2015

Using a spreadsheet limits the options in resolution of a digital image or pdf to create. A pixel image does not allow for a good zoom

## Start with a spreadsheet in February 2009

The project to create a paper timeline of human history is done by teenagers around the world. I got an endless paper roll of 10 meters length to start this project, but decided to begin with a digital version. On February 10th, 2009 I created a spreadsheet in OpenOffice 3.0 with 3 tabs for the time 4050-1450 BCE, 1550 BCE - 150 CE and 150-2050 CE. All are designed to fit on a A4 paper, so these 3 pages can be glued together for a single timeline spanning 6000 years.

### 4050 - 1450 BCE

For these 2600 years I chose a resolution of 10 years. The spreadsheet has 260 columns, but for the long periods of this time it is precise enough.

### 1550 BCE - 150 CE

The resolution of only 10 years makes it difficult to visualize shorter time perios like the 2 years that Pekachja ruled Israel from 780-778 BCE or the one year that Ahasja ruled Juda 907-906 BCE. The second tile therefore is divided into columns for 5 years and needs 340 columns for the 1700 years from 1550 BCE to 150 CE.

### 130 BCE - 2050 CE

The third tile went back to 10 years per column and needs 218 columns.

### Scale challenges

To compensate for limited printing area I created a border of 1cm around each page, so the effective width for each tile is 277 millimeter. Given the used time frame this results in different scales years/millimeter for each page. Yet this was one of the fundamental ideas of this project, to represent a larger amount of time with a bigger amount of space or length. Here are the values for comparison:
